## A reproduction code for generating semantic IDs in "Transformer Memory as a Differentiable Search Index".
Semantically Structured Identifiers are commonly used in generative IR models recently, and have deen proved effective in improving the search performance in multiple works.
This repository provide an implementation of generating semantic ids with embeddings give by Language Models (e.g. BERT).

The code is written based on the description in the original paper:
